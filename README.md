## Election-Audit Summary

This script can be utilized for other elections for a varying amount of candidates, counties, and amount of votes. It can be changed to include party affiliation instead of county name for example. Where county_name was written, we could change this to party_name, like Repulican or Democractic. This would give us the results of the political party that received a higher percentage of votes. This of course, would also need a csv file that has the appropriate headings in the row[1] position. We could also run a for loop to print the percentage of votes more the winning candidate received compared to the other two.
